# 👋 About Me

I’m a **Founder-Engineer / Systems-oriented Product Builder**.

I design and build **end-to-end software systems** where:
- business logic is explicit,
- data is auditable,
- infrastructure is treated as part of the product,
- and automation actually replaces manual work.

I focus on **backend-heavy platforms**, **AI-assisted workflows**, and **infrastructure-aware SaaS** — especially in domains where correctness matters (finance, logistics, compliance).

## 🧠 What I Build

### 🧾 Accounting & Finance Systems
- Event-driven ledgers
- Chart of Accounts & posting rules
- Invoice lifecycle & audit trails
- KSeF-ready and compliance-aware architectures

### 🤖 AI & Automation
- LLM-assisted workflows
- n8n-based automation pipelines
- Structured memory & decision logging
- AI agents integrated into real business processes (not demos)

### 🚚 Logistics & Operational Platforms
- Route planning & cost calculation
- Driver / operator workflows
- Multi-party coordination systems
- Marketplace-style backend logic

### 🖥️ Infrastructure-Aware Backends
- Self-hosted Linux servers
- API-first backend design
- Systems built to survive bad data, bad users, and partial failure

## 🔧 Core Technical Stack

### Languages
- **C++** (systems, low-level understanding)
- **Python** (automation, tooling, AI workflows)
- **PHP** (backend platforms, APIs)
- **SQL** (data modeling, accounting logic)
- **TypeScript / JavaScript** (frontend & tooling)

### Frontend
- React
- HTML / CSS
- UI focused on clarity over visual noise

### Backend & Infrastructure
- Linux
- Nginx
- Docker
- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- Cloud & VPS deployments

### Automation & AI
- n8n
- LLM orchestration
- API-driven agents
- Workflow automation replacing manual operations

## 🧠 How I Think About Software

- Systems > frameworks
- Auditability over magic
- Explicit data flows beat hidden state
- Infrastructure is part of the application
- Software should fail **predictably**, not catastrophically
- If it touches money, logs are not optional

---

## 📚 Actively Expanding Into

- Large-scale TypeScript & React systems
- Advanced backend architecture patterns
- OpenGL & lower-level rendering concepts
- More capable AI agent orchestration
- Scaling multi-tenant SaaS systems

---

## 🗣️ Languages
- 🇵🇱 Polish — native
- 🇮🇪 English — fluent
